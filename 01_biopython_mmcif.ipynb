    "# Lab 6 - Protein Structure Files and the Protein Data Bank\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are biological molecules made up of sequences of amino acids. \n",
    "Amino acids have the general structure shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"./images/amino-acid.png\" style=\"align:center\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"R\" group in the amino acid structure can have varying identities. \n",
    "Depending on the nature of the R group, the amino acid can be classified as hydrophilic or hydrophobic, postively, negatively, or neutrally charged, or other categories.\n",
    "The sequence of amino acids relative to one another is key to determining protein structure as the amino acids interact with each other to form protein secondary structure such as alpha helices or beta sheets.\n",
    "Proteins also commonly have accompanying small molecules (also called ligands) or nucleic acids (DNA or RNA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining protein structure has been an active area of research for many decades, and is part of a field called [structural biology](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/structural-biology.aspx).\n",
    "The three dimensional structure of proteins plays a role in its biological function and determines much about its interaction with other molecules. Traditionally, the three dimensional structure of proteins had to be determined through laborious experimental methods such as [X-Ray crystallography](https://phys.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD%3A_Biophysics_200A_-_Current_Techniques_in_Biophysics/X-ray_Protein_Crystallography), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, or cryo-EM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational techniques such as [homology modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homology_modeling) have also been used.\n",
    "In homology modeling, sequence fragments from known structures were matched to the unknown structure, and a model is iteratively built.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, machine learning has allowed for leaps in protein structure prediction. \n",
    "Notably, AlphaFold from Google's DeepMind was released in 2020. \n",
    "AlphaFold also very recently (October 31, 2023) announced the release of a model that is able to predict structure of complexes [containing ligands, proteins, and nucleic acids](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/a-glimpse-of-the-next-generation-of-alphafold/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/) was established in 1971 at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a repository of protein structures. \n",
    "It originally started with 7 structures. \n",
    "Today it has over 200,000 experimentally determined protein structures and **over 1 million** computed structure models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will be using a Python library called Biopython to read and analyze MMCIF files.\n",
    "Although machine learning prediction of protein structure is an exciting area, we will not be delving into that topic for this lab.\n",
    "Instead, the lab focuses on MMCIF files, Biopython, and structure analysis of proteins.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The [Biopython library](https://biopython.org/) is a powerful and versatile collection of tools specifically designed to assist biochemists and biologists with computational work. \n",
    "Biopython simplifies tasks such as working with DNA and protein sequences, interacting with online databases, and reading molecular format files like mmCIF and PDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use Biopython to parse information from an MMCIF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## MMCIF Files\n",
    "The mmCIF (also called PDBx/mmCIF) file format defines the three dimensional structure of a protein and provides information\n",
    "about the molecule, any ligands, host organism, and experimental method and conditions under which the data was obtained.\n",
    "The mmCIF file has a [specific format](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/learn/guide-to-understanding-pdb-data/beginner%E2%80%99s-guide-to-pdb-structures-and-the-pdbx-mmcif-format)\n",
    "that consists of data entries with certain keywords beginning with `_` followed by their values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a text excerpt from the PDB 101 page about the mmCIF file format:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "All data items are identified by name, begin with the underscore character and are composed of a category name and an attribute name. \n",
    "The category name is separated from the attribute name by a period:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "_citation.year\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of category and attribute may be termed an mmCIF token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data categories are presented in two styles: key-value and tabular.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the key-value style, the mmCIF token is followed directly by a corresponding value.  The following example shows the unit cell parameters from entry 4hhb:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "_cell.entry_id           4HHB\n",
    "_cell.length_a           63.150\n",
    "_cell.length_b           83.590\n",
    "_cell.length_c           53.800\n",
    "_cell.angle_alpha        90.00\n",
    "_cell.angle_beta         99.34\n",
    "_cell.angle_gamma        90.00\n",
    "_cell.Z_PDB              4\n",
    "```\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "BioPython has a function called `MMCIF2Dict` that can read this information into a Python Dictionary.\n",
    "We can then query the dictionary to pull out data we are interested in.\n",
